# Lynchburg Road Issues

This tracker is for issues with the existing sidewalk network, cycling network, and roads in Lynchburg, Virginia, USA. It is also a place for new ideas that would make the transportation networks in the city safer, more beautiful, and more efficient.

This tracker is inspired by Mateusz Konieczny's [Krakow Road Issues](https://github.com/matkoniecz/Krakow/issues) (private repo) project as well as an intention stated by the former Lynchburg City manager Bonnie Svrcek to create a [sidewalk project rating system](https://wset.com/news/local/lynchburg-to-create-sidewalk-rating-system-for-city-residents).

## Rules for issue contribution
* Use precise language to describe what is wrong or exactly what you would like to see changed
* Provide pictures or street-view screenshots of the area if possible
* Provide a link to the area on OpenStreetMap, Google Maps, etc.
