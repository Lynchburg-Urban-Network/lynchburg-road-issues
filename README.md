# Lynchburg Road Issues

This tracker is for issues with the existing sidewalk network, cycling network, and roads in Lynchburg, Virginia, USA. It is also a place for new ideas that would make the transportation networks in the city safer, more beautiful, and more efficient.

This tracker is inspired by Mateusz Konieczny's [Krakow Road Issues](https://github.com/matkoniecz/Krakow/issues/1025) project as well as an intention stated by the former Lynchburg City manager Bonnie Svrcek to create a [sidewalk project rating system](https://wset.com/news/local/lynchburg-to-create-sidewalk-rating-system-for-city-residents).
